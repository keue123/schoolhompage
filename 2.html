                <p>An interesting phenomenon that arose from social media is the concept of social proof</p>
                <p>It's easier for a person to accept new values or ideas when they see that others have already done so.</p>
                <p>if the preson they see accepting the new idea happens to be a friend then social proof has even more power by exerting peer pressure as well as relying on the trust that people put int the judgments of their close friends</p>
                <p>For example a video about some issue may be controversial on its own but more credible if it got thousands of likes.</p>
                <p>if a friend recommends the video to you, in many cases, the credibility of the idea it presents will rise in direct proportion to the trust you place int the friend recommending the video</p>
                <p>This is the power of social media and part of the reason why videos or "posts" can become "viral"</p>
